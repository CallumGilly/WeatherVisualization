# WeatherVisualization
A Program to, for a set location, provide the user with a diagram depicting diffrent elements of the weather and there change over time.

This program is inteded for use within the gliding comunity and will allow for its users to produce a graph like that shown below which presents many factors about the weather in a simple and understandable format. I am currently in the process of working out how to generate the graphs them selfs and will intialy use human inputing of the data from sites such as [top meteo](https://vfr.topmeteo.eu/en-gb/uk/start/) and [RASP](https://rasp.stratus.org.uk) however plan to develop this further with the use of free weather api's to allow for automatic generation of the graph.
